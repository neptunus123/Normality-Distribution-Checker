During the editing of an academic manuscript, most of the time we use statistics. For this use, we sometimes get reviewer comments about a misuse of mean (std dev or median(min-max for a given data set. Indeed, this decision should be given after a normality(normal distribution) check.

This tool helps you to automatically get which values should be used and the values calculated.

Shapiro-Wilk test is used for normality check.

Use it freely, as I hope it helps you in your manuscript preparation. 

:)

Good luck!
